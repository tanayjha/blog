    <p>Context This is going to be a quick blogpost on the birthday paradox. This is a famous probability theory problem, which asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. This is called a paradox and for a good reason. The solution to this problem is very counter-intuitive. This blog post is going to be an attempt to use some computer science and maths to analyze this problem and figure out why this is called a paradox.

    <p>Context I recently delved into the TCP protocol for network communication, finding it a fascinating exploration of its origins in the 1970s and its enduring role as the backbone of the internet. While TCP continues to be widely utilized, a newcomer named QUIC has emerged in recent years, touted for its enhanced efficiency compared to TCP. Many browsers and websites have already embraced QUIC, signaling a potential shift in the landscape of network protocols. But what sets QUIC apart from TCP?

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Recently I had the opportunity to read about the Diffie Hellman key exchange and found it to be fascinating. The beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Of course there is some complicated number theory involved, but overall it is pretty easy to grasp the concept intuitively as well. So let’s start with it…
What? Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method of digital encryption that securely exchanges cryptographic keys between two parties over a public channel without their conversation being transmitted over the internet. The two parties use symmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt their messages. Published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, it was one of the first practical examples of public key cryptography.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Year in books - 2022
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In the January of the year 2022, I thought of setting a goal for myself with regards to the number of books I read in a year. During my school days, I was an avid reader and was very interested in reading fiction. However, with the JEE preparation (starting from class 11th) most of that stopped. Since then, I have read multiple books on and off but never got into a habit of reading regularly. I thought a target of reading 25 books in the year although a little ambitious, might be a decent one. I had not decided on a book list or anything but wanted to focus on non-fiction. Over the years I find myself more fullfilled if I read a non-fiction book rather than a fiction one. I watched a few youtube videos and found an interesting advice about the art of reading which I was not aware of earlier which holds true for non-fiction. Most of the non-fiction books could be condensed into a blog post. They have a few points which the author wants to drive home and then they try to drill those points in the mind of the readers using various techniques/stories. So for non-fiction books, it generally doesn’t make sense to read them cover to cover. This concept is something I am still wrapping my head around. I am accustomed to reading books without skipping any page even if it is done for a formality. However, I quickly realised that this practice is really hard to keep up for non-fiction. They are generally not as gripping as fiction. In fact, people also suggest to simply skip over chapters you don’t want to read in non-fiction. This is something I still can’t do. However, I guess I have got pretty good at skipping over paragraphs/pages I don’t find particularly engaging. Another very powerful concept, which I believe I agree with, but still haven’t accepted fully is that it is the duty of an author to capture your attention for the entire duration of the book. If they are not able to do so, you can just put the book down and not read it. You are not obligated to read it. One thing that I have realised however is that not all books can be read at all points in your life. Some books only make sense when their time has come and when you are ready for them. So it is ok to not read a book until you feel ready for it.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Infinite Queens
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There is a very interesting set of events that led me to this topic. And boy am I glad that I stumbled on this. I had a lot of fun working on this and it definitely warrants a blog post. So here it goes…
Backstory I am reading the book Algorithms to Live By (a great book so far btw). In that book, there is a mention of how to manage time like a CPU Scheduler and not do too many context switches as it can affect your productivity adversely. The author mentions Donald Knuth who is a very famous computer scientist probably most famous for his book series - The Art Of Computer Programming. It was mentioned how he maintains his project TEX and since the software is relatively stable, he does a bug fix for it every 6 years and no sooner. The author mentions how he is an embodiment of minimal context switching lifestyle and focussing on just one thing at once. This is another topic of debate but not of interest in this blog post. I already knew about Knuth but just out of curiosity I searched around a bit and found these: Donald Knuth Christmas Lectures at Stanford. I started watching the 2017 lecture, A Conjecture That Had To Be True and even though the primary focus of the lecture was on a different problem (which was also pretty interesting), what caught my eye was something he mentioned at around the end of the lecture. The infinite queens problem. As much as I would like to continue this story, I think it would be better to just get into the technical details and see what this is all about.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Evaluating million digits of Pi
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently got inspired from a book I am reading, Fermat’s Last Theorem by Simon Singh, and decided to see what it takes to evaulate Pi to a large number of decimal places. I though that a million would be a good starting point, so a day later, here we are.
Now obviously, there is a lot of material out there on this as this seems to be a topic of great interest for a lot of people. I definitely find this fascinating but I also believe that there is no significance or meaning attached to the digits of pi. It is just a random string of numbers. However, I think this is true in mathematics as well as life that the things you have the most fun in doing eventually turns out to be those which you didn’t do for some material gain.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I came across this excellent video, explaining how the SHA-256 algorithm works internally. I had always been excited to understand how a real-world hashing algorithm works internally. SHA-256 is one of the most popular hashing algorithms, so after getting my hands on that video, I knew I had to try and implement this on my own. This feels like once in a lifetime opportunity. So here I am after having implemented the algorithm on my own and feeling confident understanding how SHA-256 works. I want to pass on that same confidence to the readers of this blog (probably including me in a few months :D) along with code snippets. So, lets dive right into it…

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have been meaning to write this blog for some time now but somehow kept on postponing (read procrastinating…). I read about this technique of Consistent Hashing a while back and was mesmerized by its elegance. Recently read it again in this brilliant blog and thought of expressing it in my own words for posterity. So let us begin.
Hashing I won’t talk too much about hashing since it is a very basic computer science concept. In a word, it means mapping an object to another object. Or more generally, mapping a key to a value where their types don’t matter. Mostly the mapping is from a string to int.

    <p>I recently completed this wonderful book by James Clear, Atomic Habits. More than a book review, this is going to be a compilation of the learnings that I have from this book.

The actual value of the book will come from the application of the concepts it teaches in our everyday life. But, to start things off, here goes my learnings from this great book.
