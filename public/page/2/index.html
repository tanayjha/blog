  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>If you have been programming professionally for some time, you probably would have used threads. When used correctly, threads can provide significant speed up in the program.
I had also written multithreaded programs many times at Sumo Logic. However, recently I felt that since threading is such an important topic, I should probably dive a little deeper into how things work there.
I started off by reading Java Concurrency in Practice and although I have gone through only a couple of chapters right now, but still I have discovered some interesting things which I was not aware of before.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This post is going to focus on a very simple concept, finding the GCD of two numbers. If you think this is too easy and we don’t need a post on it, well you are probably right :D. You might even be knowing of efficient ways of finding the GCD (mostly used in competitive programming). But many of you may not be aware of the mathematics and proof behind how that method works. If that is the case, you are not alone. I was in the same boat for many years. I have used that 3 line GCD method many times in solving programming questions never thinking deeply about why it works. There is no issue in this. After all there is a good reason why abstraction is so popular. But I do believe that when you get a chance there is no harm in diving deep. You may get to learn a few things and as always be fascinated by what math has to offer even in the simplest of concepts. So lets begin…

    <p>Detecting the starting point of a loop in a linked list is a very popular problem. In fact most you reading this might already be knowing the algorithm to solve this. However understanding why that algorithm works is a separate challenge altogether.
I was in the same state and decided to find an explanation of why it works. I could not find convincing explanations by simple google searches and hence decided to right this blog. Hopefully, this will satisfy the curiosity of people trying to understand the reasoning behind this algorithm.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In my post on RSA encryption system I mentioned the use of Fermat’s little theorem. In this post I am going to give a formal proof (and explain in simple terms) the theorem itself. This will also give you a chance to boast among your friends (possibly nerdy) that you know the proof to one of Fermat’s theorem ;)
THE STATEMENT Fermat’s little theorem states that: For any integer a not divisible by p and any prime p, the following always holds: a(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) The reason why the theorem states that a should not be divisible by p is very clear. Let us assume that a was divisible by p, then obviously p will divide a(p-1). So this means that a(p-1) ≡ 0 (mod p) when p | a. So this is an exception and is separately mentioned in the theorem.

    <p>In this post I would like to talk about the Chinese Remainder Theorem. You might have heard this problem as a kid: There are x number of things. When taken in groups of 5, they leave a remainder 1. When taken in groups of 7, they leave a remainder 2. When taken in groups of 9, they leave a remainder 3. And when taken in groups of 11, they leave a remainder 4. Find the value of x. We will see how such problems can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem(CRT).

    <p>THE NEED OF ENCRYPTION In today’s world where a lot of secured information like our credit card number, passwords etc., travel around the web, the presence of a secure encryption system is almost inevitable.
We want a method to encrypt a message, send it over the insecure internet connection and allow only the receiver to be able to decrypt and read the original message. This exact problem was solved by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman(RSA) in the year 1978, in their paper A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems. In this post, I will try to explain the method they adopted to create a secure encryption system.

    <p>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION The problem of finding the maximum flow in a network, has a history which dates back to the second world war.
Practically the maximum flow problem can be stated as: “A list of pipes is given, with different flow-capacities. These pipes are connected at their endpoints. What is the maximum amount of water that you can route from a given starting point to a given ending point?” or equivalently “A company owns a factory located in city X where products are manufactured that need to be transported to the distribution center in city Y. You are given the one-way roads that connect pairs of cities in the country, and the maximum number of trucks that can drive along each road. What is the maximum number of trucks that the company can send to the distribution center?”
